A sextant is primarily designed for angular measurements of the altitude of the Sun, or stars (latitude determination), or for measurements of the angular separation between landmarks or landmark features (e.g. distance and height determination).

Solar altitude measurement: The sextant is held vertically with one hand, as shown. Swinging the center arm with the opposite hand rotates the top mirror, until an image of the sun is reflected into the eye piece tube (right center). En-route to the eye piece, sunlight passes through a protective mylar screen (top left, re-purposed from solar eclipse glasses) and reflects from a fixed-angle "alignment" mirror (left). The "alignment mirror's left side is cut off to give the observer a simultaneous unobstructed view of the horizon. When the sun's disk appears to be superimposed on the horizon, the scale at the bottom of the arm indicates the sun's altitude. At solar noon, the Sun's altitude (minus the Sun's declination on the given day of year) directly corresponds to the observer's latitude.
