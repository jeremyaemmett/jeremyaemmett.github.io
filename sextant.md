The sextant is held vertically with one hand, as shown. Swinging the central arm with the other hand rotates the top mirror, until an image of the sun reflects into the eye piece tube (right center). En-route to the eye piece, sunlight passes through a protective mylar screen (top left, re-purposed from solar eclipse glasses) and reflects off of a fixed-angle "alignment" mirror (left). The "alignment mirror's left side is cut off to give the observer a simultaneous unobstructed view of the horizon. When the sun's disk appears to be superimposed on the horizon, the scale at the bottom of the arm indicates the sun's altitude.
