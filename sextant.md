A sextant is primarily designed for Sun or star angular altitude measurements (for latitude determination), or landmark feature separation measurements (for e.g. landmark distance and height determination).

Solar angular altitude measurement:
The sextant is held vertically with respect to the horizon, facing the direction of the sun. Rotating the arm rotates the top mirror, until an image of the sun is reflected into the eye piece (right center). En-route, sunlight passes through a protective mylar film (re-purposed from solar eclipse glasses) and reflects from a fixed "alignment" mirror (left). The "alignment" mirror is horizontally shortened to give the user a simultaneous unobstructed view of the horizon. When the sun's disk appears to overlap with the horizon, the bottom scale indicates the sun's altitude. At solar noon, the Sun's altitude (minus the Sun's declination on that particular day) equals the observer's latitude.
