# Apollo 11 Simulated Outbound Trajectory

#### _[&larr; Main](index.md)_

Apollo 11's translunar trajectory burn and lunar orbit insertion are simulated kinematically with velocity impulses and (Euler) integrated Earth/Moon gravity. The "camera" tracks the spacecraft's retrograde trajectory, and Earth's spacecraft-side is correlated with mission photographs.
