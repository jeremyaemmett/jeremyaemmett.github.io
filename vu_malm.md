# VU-MALM

A processed-based model of greenhouse gas chemistry in active layer environments (_Python_), with a focus on microbial biochemistry/population dynamics and methane surface flux prediction. 

Model calculations are largely derived from 10.1029/2019MS001867 ('_A Microbial-Functional Group-Based CH4 Model..._' by Song et al. (2020)), but are applied to a high-vertical resolution active layer domain subject to seasonally-evolving thaw-freeze dynamics, and driven by hydro-thermodynamic forcing fields from CryoGrid model output. 

A number of accessory codes are included - these assist with standardization of VU-MALM and CryoGrid input data; CryoGrid configuration, running, and post-processing tasks; automatic tuning of VU-MALM variables to achieve target fluxes; and plotting of VU-MALM output.
