# VU-MALM

A processed-based model of greenhouse gas dynamics in active layer environments (_Python_), with a focus on microbial biochemistry/population dynamics and methane surface flux prediction. 

Model calculations are inspired by 10.1029/2019MS001867 ('_A Microbial-Functional Group-Based CH4 Model..._' by Song et al. (2020)), but are applied with high vertical resolution to a simulated active layer subject to subarctic seasonal freeze-thaw. Driving hydro-thermodynamic forcing data are derived from CryoGrid, a dedicated Cryosphere land-surface model.
