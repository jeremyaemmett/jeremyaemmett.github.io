Vrije Universiteit Microbial Active Layer Model

A 1-D, processed-based, multilayer model of greenhouse gas dynamics in active layer environments (_Python_), with a focus on microbial biochemistry/population dynamics and methane surface flux prediction. 

Model calculations are modified from [Song [2020]](https://atmos.sysu.edu.cn/sites/atmos.prod1.dpcms4.sysu.edu.cn/files/inline-files/song-2020-JAMES.pdf), [Chadburn [2020]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GB006678), [Reed [2014]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1313713111), and applied to a high vertical-resolution simulated active layer undergoing seasonal freeze-thaw. Driving hydro-thermodynamic forcing data are derived from [CryoGrid](https://github.com/CryoGrid/CryoGridCommunity_source), a dedicated Cryosphere LSM.
