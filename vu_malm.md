### VU-MALM

A processed-based model of greenhouse gas chemistry in active layer environments,  written in Python, with a focus on microbial biochemistry/population dynamics and methane surface flux prediction. Model calculations are largely derived from 10.1029/2019MS001867 ('A Microbial-Functional Group-Based CH4 Model Integrated into a Terrestrial Ecosystem Model...' by Song et al. (2020)), but are modified for a high-vertical resolution active layer domain constrained by thaw-freeze dynamics and driven by hydro-thermodynamic forcing fields from CryoGrid simulation output. A number of accessory codes are included in addition to the main model code - these assist with standardization of input data formats; configuration, running, and post-processing of the CryoGrid forcing model; a genetic algorithm for automatic tuning of VU-MALM variables to achieve target fluxes; and plotting routines.
