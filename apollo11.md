# Spacecraft observation geometry (in-prep, Python)

#### _[&larr; Main](index.md)_

Apollo 11's translunar trajectory burn and lunar orbit insertion are simulated kinematically with velocity impulses and (Eulerian) integrated Earth/Moon gravity. The "camera" tracks the spacecraft's (post-launch) retrograde trajectory, and Earth's spacecraft-facing side is correlated with mission photographs.
