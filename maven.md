# Spacecraft observation geometry (in-prep, Python)

Ungraduate work in 2012-2014 involved prediction of future observational geometries of the IUVS (Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph) instrument aboard the MAVEN mars orbiter, to identify optimal time windows for observations of aurorae during the instrument's apoapsis (full-disk) scan phases. Software was developed in an IDL (Interactive Data Language) framework.

Scan footprints were represented on cylindrical planetary maps displaying day/night regions and magnetic field topology.

A Python re-make is in development, for interest's sake, utilizing more modularized kernel downloading tools and more sophisticated visualization capabilities.
